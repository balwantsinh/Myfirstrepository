+Advantages of waterfall model
1. Quality of product will be good

2. Since changes are not allowed, obviously less bugs

3. Initial investments are also less, since testers are hired at a later stage

4. Preferred for smaller projects which are less or not at all dynamic in nature


Advantages of Spiral model
Testing is done for every cycle
Customer will get to use the software for every version/module
Change in requirements are accommodated

Disadvantage:


QA vs QC vs QE

Quality Assurance is process related
Quality Control is software testing
Quality Engineering/Engineer (Automation Software Tester)
